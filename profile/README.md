# Development Guidelines
## Branch Structure
So we would be following Three branch structure `main` , `develop` and `release`

### main
This branch is meant for backup so never push here
- `note` this branch will have code one version lower
### develop
We would working on this branch !
- Fork the branch then fork your forked branch to your `local system`
- make local branches at your system for the issues your working on once the issue is solved merge it with develop branch at your local
- push it to your forked repo at github and then send `pull request`
- `note` never push the local made branches for issue at your `local system`
  `for example` if i am asked to add forget password feature i will make seperate branch for feature at my local once the work is done i will merge it with develop in my local then push it to forked repo at github and will send `Pull Request` to develop branch in main project
### release 
This branch will have production code
### merge conflicts
- all the issue related to merge conflicts will be managed by me so focus on the issue assigned to the particular developer and `happy coding :)`
